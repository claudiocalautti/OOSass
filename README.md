OOSass
===

A scaffold for sass/scss based projects.

See [this article](http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project) and extend as you need.


**Modules**

The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS, things like mixin declarations, functions, variables, placeholder selectors.


**Partials**

The partials directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed. Break stylesheets into (header, content, sidebar, and footer components and a few others), or break into much finer categories (typography, buttons, textboxes, selectboxes, etcâ€¦).


**Views**

The views directory is where page specific styles are constructed and partials combined or (if needed) modified and adapted to their container.


**Folder Structure**
